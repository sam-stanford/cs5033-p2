This report provides an overview of an architecture for the system described in Appendix \ref{appendix: scenario}, along with a detailed breakdown of architecting process and system requirements, an implementation plan, and a critical evaluation of the proposed architecture.

The architecting process described in Section \ref{sect: process} is detailed, and the requirements analysis completed in Section \ref{sect: requirements} is thorough, and considers situations which could be considered ambiguous in the original specification.

The proposed architecture itself employs a wide variety of both common and unusual architectural features, patterns, and styles to shape the proposed architecture towards the needs of the target system, including the application of the client-server pattern (see \S\ref{sect: architecture: clients}) and a multilevel priority queue (see \S\ref{sect: architecture: patient information svc}).

The evaluation completed for the architecture and the proposed implementation plan for the architecture in Section \ref{sect: implementation} are both detailed and demonstrate substantial knowledge of the software architecture paradigm.

Overall, this practical has been completed to a high standard and fulfils the base specification, as well as completing several minor extensions.
