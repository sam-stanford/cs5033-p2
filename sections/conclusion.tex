Overall, this report provides an overview of an architecture for the system described in Appendix \ref{appendix: scenario}, along with a detailed breakdown of architecting process and system requirements, an implementation plan, and a critical evaluation of the proposed architecture.

The architecture employs a wide variety of both common and unusual architectural features, patterns, and styles to shape the proposed architecture towards the needs of the target system, including the application of the client-server pattern (see \S\ref{sect: architecture: clients}) and a multilevel priority queue (see \S\ref{sect: architecture: patient information svc}).
