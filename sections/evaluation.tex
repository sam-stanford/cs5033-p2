\todo{we were thinking about two separate info svcs, so maybe argue the case as to why / why not}






\subsection{Current Considerations}

\subsubsection*{Authentication Performance Bottleneck}
- All devices must communicate with auth service
- Can be imrpoved by replicating and distributing replicas, but this adds significant amount of complexity


\subsubsection*{Architect Biases}
- IRA
- did a lot of research on styles
- natural biases
- influence from past project \& current trends
- SOA is held highly
- monolithic layered are shunned (good for critical system)


\subsubsection*{Data Loss in Event-Driven Styles}
- SAM
- Ambulance \& GP service can lose info (responsibility down to devs to req-reply)

- Patient Info service priority queues do not back up info
- Tricky to fix, but maybe just better to ignore, as information such as blood pressure can quickly be regathered


\subsubsection*{BFF \& Gateway Patterns}
- SAM
- using both rather than just one might be considered unusual
- reuse functionality through gateway (e.g. security filters)
- some can't be (e.g. req coalescing)
- Combining both is beneficial



\subsubsection*{Patient Information Service Bloating}
- SAM
\todo{rename sect}

- one svc vs many services


\subsubsection*{Pub-Sub Message Loss}
- SAM
- potential issue
- relies on implementation to get correct (developer vigilance)




\subsubsection*{Size}
- IRA

- Splitting into teams could be Tricky
- Overarching architects or not? (trade-offs)






\subsubsection*{Data Security}
- SAM
- Sensitive data
- Stored in one database, so checks can be applied \& added easily
- OAuth 2 is pretty proven (used by FB, etc.)




\subsection{Lifecycle Considerations}

\subsubsection*{System Evolution}
- IRA
- Arch is flexible \& maintainable w.r.t. future changes
- Application of component principles helps with this
- Documentation


\subsubsection*{Architectural Drift \& Erosion}
- IRA

- Documentation

- From lack of dev vigilance:
- stick with arch
- uphold boundaries
- write docs
- remove cruft (cite Martin Fowler)
- team
- some hoisting has been applied (e.g. service separation), but still left to developers
- SOA is not \textbf{that} important in an arch, but instead we should focus on boundaries (see Clean Architectrue book ch 27 \cite{cleanArch-Services})
