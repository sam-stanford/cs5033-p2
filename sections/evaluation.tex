\todo{we were thinking about two separate info svcs, so maybe argue the case as to why / why not}

\todo{SOA is not \textbf{that} important in an arch, but instead we should focus on boundaries (see Clean Architectrue book ch 27 \cite{cleanArch-Services})}

\subsubsection*{Data Loss in Event-Driven Styles}
- Ambulance \& GP service can lose info (responsibility down to devs to req-reply)

- Patient Info service priority queues do not back up info
- Tricky to fix, but maybe just better to ignore, as information such as blood pressure can quickly be regathered


\subsubsection*{BFF \& Gateway Patterns}
- using both rather than just one might be considered unusual
- reuse functionality through gateway (e.g. security filters)
- some can't be (e.g. req coalescing)
- Combining both is beneficial
