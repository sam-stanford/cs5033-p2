This report explores an example architecture for a healthcare system which handles the management of patient information and appointments. The process of creating the architecture is explored in Sections \ref{sect: process} and \ref{sect: requirements}, with the resulting architecture being described in Section \ref{sect: architecture}; Sections \ref{sect: implementation} and \ref{sect: evaluation} provide an implementation plan for and a critical evaluation of the chosen architecture respectively. The report is completed by a conclusion (\S\ref{sect: conclusion}) and set of references.
